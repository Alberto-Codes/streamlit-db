Taco manual is Beria yes birya it's really having a moment here in the United States though it has been a super popular Taco filling and entree in Mexico for shall we say centuries now in Mexico it is often made with different kinds of meat where it's the most famous which is West Central Mexico Guadalajara and around in that area it is typically made either with goat or with lamb and I have that right here in front of me this piece of goat meat here is part of the leg meat this lamb is a lamb shoulder roast you want to get the ones with the bones in if at all possible now you may be asking where could I find goat that very common thing in Mexico well you would look at a Mexican grocery store or in a Middle Eastern grocery store oftentimes you will find goat there as well what does goat taste like if you haven't ever had it I always say it tastes a little bit like a cross between pork and lamb so it's a little richer in flavor than lamb is and a little more succulent if you get a small lamb now in other parts of Mexico especially in the north they will make birria out of beef so I have a cha a piece of Chuck here a piece of Chuck if you can get it with the bones in it but I will tell you that if you want to have the absolute most luxurious birria that you have ever had or could ever have then I would use short ribs so get a big chunk of short rib and use that you're always looking for someplace around four pounds if it doesn't have bones around three pounds for the recipe that I'm going to show you what is birya made into a taco well it is the meat that is slow simmered in a light red chili sauce and then you take the meat out and brown it up a little bit and you dash it with some of that delicious juice and almost always when you get a birya taco you will get a little cup of the braising juices on the side which just makes everybody absolutely happy you dip it in there and it's just absolutely delicious well that's a topic for another time okay so what do you have to do to turn these pieces of meat into birya well first you got to make a marinade I'm gonna make this birya marinade from guajillo chili so it's a smooth skin chili and it has a sort of cranberry red color to it you want to choose ones that have this really dark cranberry color to them because they're going to be the most flavorful of course you have to process through them all by taking the stem end off and then I just use my finger some people like to use scissors to do it but it slows me down too much so I just use my finger to tear open the side of it now when you do open it up you'll see that some of the seeds will be still attached to the seed pod and veins so you want to kind of pull those out and then shake out all of the seeds here and then I always tear them into large pieces flat pieces that's going to make this whole thing go really fast so I've already done all the rest of the chilies here and we're going to go over to the the I have a griddle going here you'll probably want to use a like a large 12 inch skillet for this kind of thing if you don't have a double burner griddle like this one but we need to toast these their flavor is so enhanced if you toast them and what I like to do is to spread them into a single layer on the The Griddle for even toasting I know not everybody does this but for even toasting I will say I like to just press them down this is the reason that I like to work with them in flat pieces because this goes so incredibly well and as they start to toast they will change color slightly on the inside you will notice that they start to actually lighten up in color if you can see this how much lighter it is on this section that is the the color that we're looking for and as they toast and lighten up in color they will also release a lot of their Aroma into the kitchen so I'm going to press this down my griddle is always much cooler on one end than it is in the middle so now I moved everything back to the center where it's way uh way warmer way hotter so that I can then do this toasting a little bit faster I use my nose for this a lot and when I really smell the aroma of the chilies released I know that they are getting really close but they also change color as I showed you just a moment ago you'll notice that on the back here of my of my griddle I have some whole cloves of garlic but they're whole cloves of garlic that are in their papery skins and I am roasting those there you could do that alongside the chilies as you're working here they'll take about 15 minutes to get completely soft soft is what you're looking for here and they will probably get little black spots on them in places so as I'm working through this here I will meet you back when I've got them all toasted and we're ready to rehydrate them these chilies just smell so good just hot tap water is to me the best way to rehydrate them some people boil them but I think it takes too much of their flavor away when I get enough of the hot tap water here so that they float freely I'm going to put a plate on top of them just so that it keeps them submerged here and they will rehydrate evenly I'm going to let them go for about 20 minutes okay the garlic has cooled off enough that I can handle it here and I am peeling the papery skin off of that that will go into this blender jar here I'll collect all of that there we have now our rehydrated dried chilies which are really the star of the show for this marinade and I'm going to put all of them into this blender jar as well just pick them up and and slide them in here now one thing that you do have to know is that the guajillo chili while it has a really bright flavor and very mild heat does have a very tough skin so I'm using a high speed blender here a Vitamix if you don't have a high speed blender you will probably want to strain this mixture after you blend it just because those Skins are really tough so I measured one cup of the soaking liquid for the chilies and now I'm going to put the spices in here about a teaspoon of Mexican oregano will go in and I have cumin and black pepper Mexican oregano cumin and black pepper are sort of a triumvirate that you see in a lot of recipes especially ones that are red chili sauces in that West Central section of Mexico I always keep a small molcajete that's the Lava Rock Grinding Stone from Mexico I keep a small one right beside my stove so that I can Crush spices right before I use them so that they're the most flavorful once I get them started it's the black pepper that you have to kind of go in there and get started by crushing it then I do a circular motion to actually turn it into a real powder here and boy that Aroma is really dynamic as well so the black pepper and cumin will go in I always keep a little Brush by my molcajete there so that I can use that to get that out okay now we've got three tablespoons of vinegar I'm using an apple cider vinegar and then I'm going to put in a real big generous teaspoon of salt this is this recipe is going to get more salt as we go along because that wouldn't be enough for one for all of the meat that we're using but this will get us started in the flavoring of the marinade itself so now comes the blending you always want to do this on high and you want to do it until you can feel this sauce between your your fingers and notice that most all of the chili skin has been Blended smooth foreign there you can see that it's actually heated up by the blades of the blender there so I'm putting all of this over the piece of lamb that I'm using here that lamb shoulder roast that I showed you before so that just goes all over this and I'm going to it covered it really beautifully but I'm going to add it now um four cups of water and I'm going to pour that sort of around the outside of this and the technique for cooking that I'm going to show you is the braising technique so usually when you're braising things it will be about half submerge the meat will be about half submerged and that's kind of what we've got here I'm going to put the top on this you're going to do this like in a large Dutch oven something heavy is the best piece of equipment for this kind of thing but if you're a slow cooker person hey do it in a slow cooker you will reduce the water to one cup okay because there's not as much evaporation in that this has four cups in it I've set my oven to 325 degrees so I'm going to slide this in here and I'm going to cook it for about three hours I'm about after two and a half hours I'll go in and check it and make sure that not too much of the liquid has simmered away this is the moment that you always wait for of course because uh you pull it out and you take the top off of it if you've been cooking this in a slow cooker of course it's already filled the house with that delicious Aroma for hours and hours and hours so let's see what we've got here I took a peek earlier just to make sure that it had the right amount of liquid around in it so look at that well it is incredibly aromatic now I am going to take the meat out of here first and remember that it will probably come out in big chunks which we will then break into smaller pieces but we want to work on this braising liquid now so we've got the big pieces of the meat out now I need some fat for this so I'm actually going to pull a uh Ladle up here and tip this up on the side and then collect all the fat off the top so you don't want to be doing this with a really lean cut that's why I'm always choosing to use something like a shoulder roast because there's usually a fair amount of fat and remember I did not encourage you to cut any of the fat off of this but now we're going to degrease this broth because we're going to use the fat both to Brown some of this meat upright before we serve it and also to kind of crisp some tortillas this is a very standard part of making really good birya I need to measure and see how much of this braising liquid we actually have to work with here so I'm going to pour this into a measuring cup because I need about two cups of it let's see what we've got well looks like I hit exactly two cups um if it was more than that I would encourage you to boil it down until you reach that concentration that two top two cup concentration but here I'm going to just simply put it on a very low heat so that it is hot when we want to serve it now our next step here and all of this by the way can be done well in advance of your serving so I always suggest to people that they get their Media made get the meat off of the bones work through like I've got a lot of little bones here that I'm pulling out and then you just look at how incredibly tender that meat is it just folds into large and coarse shreds um there's a little bit more I can get off of that but mostly that is just bone there let's look over here in this piece so you'll see that this is going to come off and let this bone come out in one great big piece um and I think that's going to be kind of what we want to look at there I can use a knife on a lot of these bigger pieces to help me cut them into large shreds but just a couple of these pieces like that so you'll see what I'm going to do here is I'm going to use my knife more as a shredding device like that but everything that's small you'll be able to just tear up with a pair of tongs see oh look at how beautiful that exterior piece of the birya is okay okay that is just very very beautifully shredding on its own there okay now I have a large skillet that is on the back here this is best done with a non-stick skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet if that's what you have access to but I have it here on about a medium high heat and my next step is going to be to take some of this fat just a little bit of this fat that was a little bit of the braising juices there so I got a little bit more than just the fat and now I'm going to put the the meat in here so I can start to crisp it a little bit if you've been to a birrieria you notice that a lot of them don't do this step but my favorite ones are the ones that brown the meat a little bit before they make tacos for you so that's my standard way of doing it ground meat always to me has more flavor so we'll just let this crisp up for a minute or two here and then we're ready to start making tacos I'm going to give a little seasoning to our broth here if it looks thick thin it out a little bit because this should be like a consummate is what they would call it in Mexico or a broth um let me just stir that in and give it a taste see where we are hmm it'd be great for dipping these little birya tacos so I've got tortillas here and I am going to show you the sort of standard technique now lots of dakarias will heat their tortillas by putting them dipping them in a little bit of oil so no different here but I like about a third into the fat that we separated out and then I just move them around so that you can be sure that they're completely coated if you'd like to flip them over that's fine too just to make sure that they're nice and evenly coated here that all looks good now we've got our meat that has browned nicely here the browned meat to me is the real trick to Great media and I'm going to put some of that on each one of these tortillas foreign classic accompaniments for this are onions and cilantro I know that sounds absolutely basic but I will tell you there is nothing better but make sure you use a white onion not a yellow onion for this because it's going to give you that crisp texture and that really light Flavor now you could use Mexican hot sauce for this like tamasula or Valentina if you want but a homemade salsa that is made with garlic roasted garlic especially in arble chilies is really my go-to for birria tacos so I will put a little of that on the top of it so I'm leaving these on here long enough that I can crisp them lightly underneath so that should be the right amount of time there and then just fold them over and I am going to flip them here so that I can get a little bit more color on them I'm going to move that one up there um wow this looking great okay so you see a little bit of Browning coming on these guys here yeah they're beautiful just get a light Christmas now we're not going for all the way crispy or at all that also helps when you dunk them into the biria broth I'll put these guys over here we have our seasoned broth to serve alongside them so we'll do that of course you're going to want some limes to go with this because against the richness of that meat you're going to love having the the tanginess of the lime I always like to put a little bit of finishing salt on these guys right before serving so a little Malden salt is my choice for that but any kind of salt of course will work and then the moment has arrived so you take the little slightly crisping taco I miss the lime and I'm not going to miss that here that's going to be absolutely necessary so squeeze that over the top and then you dip it in like that that's heaven", metadata={'source': '4goWRdnF-EU', 'title': 'BIRRIA TACOS | Rick

"be able to just tear up with a pair of tongs see oh look at how beautiful that exterior piece of the birya is okay okay that is just very very beautifully shredding on its own there okay now I have a large skillet that is on the back here this is best done with a non-stick skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet if that's what you have access to but I have it here on about a medium high heat and my next step is going to be to take some of this fat just a little bit of this fat that was a little bit of the braising juices there so I got a little bit more than just the fat and now I'm going to put the the meat in here so I can start to crisp it a little bit if you've been to a birrieria you notice that a lot of them don't do this step but my favorite ones are the ones that brown the meat a little bit before they make tacos for you so that's my standard way of doing it ground meat always to me has more flavor so we'll just let this crisp up for a minute or two here and then we're ready to start making tacos I'm going to give a little seasoning to our broth here if it looks thick thin it out a little bit because this should be like a consummate is what they would call it in Mexico or a broth um let me just stir that in and give it a taste see where we are hmm it'd be great for dipping these little birya tacos so I've got tortillas here and I am going to show you the sort of standard technique now lots of dakarias will heat their tortillas by putting them dipping them in a little bit of oil so no different here but I like about a third into the fat that we separated out and then I just move them around so that you can be sure that they're completely coated if you'd like to flip them over that's fine too just to make sure that they're nice and evenly coated here that all looks good now we've got our meat that has browned nicely here the browned meat to me is the real trick to Great media and I'm going to put some of that on each one of these tortillas foreign classic accompaniments for this are onions and cilantro I know that sounds absolutely basic but I will tell you there is nothing better but make sure you use a white onion not a yellow onion for this because it's going to give you that crisp texture and that really light Flavor now you could use Mexican hot sauce for this like tamasula or Valentina if you want but a homemade salsa that is made with garlic roasted garlic especially in arble chilies is really my go-to for birria tacos so I will put a little of that on the top of it so I'm leaving these on here long enough that I can crisp them lightly underneath so that should be the right amount of time there and then just fold them over and I am going to flip them here so that I can get a little bit more color on them I'm going to move that one up there um wow this looking great okay so you see a little bit of Browning coming on these guys here yeah they're beautiful just get a light Christmas now we're not going for all the way crispy or at all that also helps when you dunk them into the biria broth I'll put these guys over here we have our seasoned broth to serve alongside them so we'll do that of course you're going to want some limes to go with this because against the richness of that meat you're going to love having the the tanginess of the lime I always like to put a little bit of finishing salt on these guys right before serving so a little Malden salt is my choice for that but any kind of salt of course will work and then the moment has arrived so you take the little slightly crisping taco I miss the lime and I'm not going to miss that here that's going to be absolutely necessary so squeeze that over the top and then you dip it in like that that's heaven"

Write a concise summary of the following:


" In this video, the speaker explains how to make Birria, a popular Mexican taco filling and entree. The recipe begins with marinating the meat (goat, lamb, beef, or short rib) in a guajillo chili sauce. The chilies are toasted in a skillet to enhance their flavor. The meat is then slow simmered in a light red chili sauce, browned, and served with the braising juices.

 This guide covers the process of toasting dried chilies, roasting garlic cloves, and rehydrating the chilies with hot tap water. Spices, vinegar, and salt are then added to the mixture to create marinade, which is then blended and used to cover a piece of lamb.

 This article provides an overview of the technique for braising a lamb shoulder roast and preparing birya. It covers the process of submerging the meat, cooking it for two and a half hours, degreasing the broth, and shredding the meat before serving. It provides tips on how to prepare the meat and broth, and emphasizes the importance of using a fatty cut of meat to add flavor.

 This is a step-by-step guide to making Mexican birria tacos. The process involves crisping the ground meat in a skillet, seasoning the broth, and lightly frying the tortillas in fat. Toppings such as onions, cilantro, and salsa are then added, and the tacos are finished with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of salt."

"hmm [Music] barrier [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to my kitchen the next page in our Taco manual is Beria yes birya it's really having a moment here in the United States though it has been a super popular Taco filling and entree in Mexico for shall we say centuries now in Mexico it is often made with different kinds of meat where it's the most famous which is West Central Mexico Guadalajara and around in that area it is typically made either with goat or with lamb and I have that right here in front of me this piece of goat meat here is part of the leg meat this lamb is a lamb shoulder roast you want to get the ones with the bones in if at all possible now you may be asking where could I find goat that very common thing in Mexico well you would look at a Mexican grocery store or in a Middle Eastern grocery store oftentimes you will find goat there as well what does goat taste like if you haven't ever had it I always say it tastes a little bit like a cross between pork and lamb so it's a little richer in flavor than lamb is and a little more succulent if you get a small lamb now in other parts of Mexico especially in the north they will make birria out of beef so I have a cha a piece of Chuck here a piece of Chuck if you can get it with the bones in it but I will tell you that if you want to have the absolute most luxurious birria that you have ever had or could ever have then I would use short ribs so get a big chunk of short rib and use that you're always looking for someplace around four pounds if it doesn't have bones around three pounds for the recipe that I'm going to show you what is birya made into a taco well it is the meat that is slow simmered in a light red chili sauce and then you take the meat out and brown it up a little bit and you dash it with some of that delicious juice and almost always when you get a birya taco you will get a little cup of the braising juices on the side which just makes everybody absolutely happy you dip it in there and it's just absolutely delicious well that's a topic for another time okay so what do you have to do to turn these pieces of meat into birya well first you got to make a marinade I'm gonna make this birya marinade from guajillo chili so it's a smooth skin chili and it has a sort of cranberry red color to it you want to choose ones that have this really dark cranberry color to them because they're going to be the most flavorful of course you have to process through them all by taking the stem end off and then I just use my finger some people like to use scissors to do it but it slows me down too much so I just use my finger to tear open the side of it now when you do open it up you'll see that some of the seeds will be still attached to the seed pod and veins so you want to kind of pull those out and then shake out all of the seeds here and then I always tear them into large pieces flat pieces that's going to make this whole thing go really fast so I've already done all the rest of the chilies here and we're going to go over to the the I have a griddle going here you'll probably want to use a like a large 12 inch skillet for this kind of thing if you don't have a double burner griddle like this one but we need to toast these their flavor is so enhanced if you toast them and what I like to do is to spread them into a single layer on the The Griddle for even toasting I know not everybody does this but for even toasting I will say I like to just press them down this is the reason that I like to work with them in flat pieces because this goes so incredibly well and as they start to toast they will change color slightly on the inside you will notice that they start to actually lighten up in color if you can see this how much lighter it is on this section that is the the color that we're looking for and as they toast and lighten up in color they will also release a lot of their Aroma into the kitchen so I'm going to press this down my griddle is always much cooler on one"

all of this over the piece of lamb that I'm using here that lamb shoulder roast that I showed you before so that just goes all over this and I'm going to it covered it really beautifully but I'm going to add it now um four cups of water and I'm going to pour that sort of around the outside of this and the technique for cooking that I'm going to show you is the braising technique so usually when you're braising things it will be about half submerge the meat will be about half submerged and that's kind of what we've got here I'm going to put the top on this you're going to do this like in a large Dutch oven something heavy is the best piece of equipment for this kind of thing but if you're a slow cooker person hey do it in a slow cooker you will reduce the water to one cup okay because there's not as much evaporation in that this has four cups in it I've set my oven to 325 degrees so I'm going to slide this in here and I'm going to cook it for about three hours I'm about after two and a half hours I'll go in and check it and make sure that not too much of the liquid has simmered away this is the moment that you always wait for of course because uh you pull it out and you take the top off of it if you've been cooking this in a slow cooker of course it's already filled the house with that delicious Aroma for hours and hours and hours so let's see what we've got here I took a peek earlier just to make sure that it had the right amount of liquid around in it so look at that well it is incredibly aromatic now I am going to take the meat out of here first and remember that it will probably come out in big chunks which we will then break into smaller pieces but we want to work on this braising liquid now so we've got the big pieces of the meat out now I need some fat for this so I'm actually going to pull a uh Ladle up here and tip this up on the side and then collect all the fat off the top so you don't want to be doing this with a really lean cut that's why I'm always choosing to use something like a shoulder roast because there's usually a fair amount of fat and remember I did not encourage you to cut any of the fat off of this but now we're going to degrease this broth because we're going to use the fat both to Brown some of this meat upright before we serve it and also to kind of crisp some tortillas this is a very standard part of making really good birya I need to measure and see how much of this braising liquid we actually have to work with here so I'm going to pour this into a measuring cup because I need about two cups of it let's see what we've got well looks like I hit exactly two cups um if it was more than that I would encourage you to boil it down until you reach that concentration that two top two cup concentration but here I'm going to just simply put it on a very low heat so that it is hot when we want to serve it now our next step here and all of this by the way can be done well in advance of your serving so I always suggest to people that they get their Media made get the meat off of the bones work through like I've got a lot of little bones here that I'm pulling out and then you just look at how incredibly tender that meat is it just folds into large and coarse shreds um there's a little bit more I can get off of that but mostly that is just bone there let's look over here in this piece so you'll see that this is going to come off and let this bone come out in one great big piece um and I think that's going to be kind of what we want to look at there I can use a knife on a lot of these bigger pieces to help me cut them into large shreds but just a couple of these pieces like that so you'll see what I'm going to do here is I'm going to use my knife more as a shredding device like that but everything that's small you'll be able to just tear up with a pair of tongs see oh look at how beautiful that exterior piece of the birya is okay okay that is just very very beautifully shredding on its own there okay now I have a

You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions about youtube videos based on the video's transcript: that we're looking for and as they toast and lighten up in color they will also release a lot of their Aroma into the kitchen so I'm going to press this down my griddle is always much cooler on one end than it is in the middle so now I moved everything back to the center where it's way uh way warmer way hotter so that I can then do this toasting a little bit faster I use my nose for this a lot and when I really smell the aroma of the chilies released I know that they are getting really close but they also change color as I showed you just a moment ago you'll notice that on the back here of my of my griddle I have some whole cloves of garlic but they're whole cloves of garlic that are in their papery skins and I am roasting those there you could do that alongside the chilies as you're working here they'll take about 15 minutes to get completely soft soft is what you're looking for here and they will probably get little black spots on them in places so as I'm working through this here I will meet you back when I've got them all toasted and we're ready to rehydrate them these chilies just smell so good just hot tap water is to me the best way to rehydrate them some people boil them but I think it takes too much of their flavor away when I get enough of the hot tap water here so that they float freely I'm going to put a plate on top of them just so that it keeps them submerged here and they will rehydrate evenly I'm going to let them go for about 20 minutes okay the garlic has cooled off enough that I can handle it here and I am peeling the papery skin off of that that will go into this blender jar here I'll collect all of that there we have now our rehydrated dried chilies which are really the star of the show for this marinade and I'm going to put all of them into this blender jar as well just pick them up and and slide them in here now one thing that you do have to know is that the guajillo chili while it has a really bright flavor and very mild heat does have a very tough skin so I'm using a high speed blender here a Vitamix if you don't have a high speed blender you will probably want to strain this mixture after you blend it just because those Skins are really tough so I measured one cup of the soaking liquid for the chilies and now I'm going to put the spices in here about a teaspoon of Mexican oregano will go in and I have cumin and black pepper Mexican oregano cumin and black pepper are sort of a triumvirate that you see in a lot of recipes especially ones that are red chili sauces in that West Central section of Mexico I always keep a small molcajete that's the Lava Rock Grinding Stone from Mexico I keep a small one right beside my stove so that I can Crush spices right before I use them so that they're the most flavorful once I get them started it's the black pepper that you have to kind of go in there and get started by crushing it then I do a circular motion to actually turn it into a real powder here and boy that Aroma is really dynamic as well so the black pepper and cumin will go in I always keep a little Brush by my molcajete there so that I can use that to get that out okay now we've got three tablespoons of vinegar I'm using an apple cider vinegar and then I'm going to put in a real big generous teaspoon of salt this is this recipe is going to get more salt as we go along because that wouldn't be enough for one for all of the meat that we're using but this will get us started in the flavoring of the marinade itself so now comes the blending you always want to do this on high and you want to do it until you can feel this sauce between your your fingers and notice that most all of the chili skin has been Blended smooth foreign there you can see that it's actually heated up by the blades of the blender there so I'm putting all of this over the piece of lamb that I'm using here that lamb shoulder roast that I showed you before so that just goes all over this and I'm going to it covered it really beautifully but I'm all of this over the piece of lamb that I'm using here that lamb shoulder roast that I showed you before so that just goes all over this and I'm going to it covered it really beautifully but I'm going to add it now um four cups of water and I'm going to pour that sort of around the outside of this and the technique for cooking that I'm going to show you is the braising technique so usually when you're braising things it will be about half submerge the meat will be about half submerged and that's kind of what we've got here I'm going to put the top on this you're going to do this like in a large Dutch oven something heavy is the best piece of equipment for this kind of thing but if you're a slow cooker person hey do it in a slow cooker you will reduce the water to one cup okay because there's not as much evaporation in that this has four cups in it I've set my oven to 325 degrees so I'm going to slide this in here and I'm going to cook it for about three hours I'm about after two and a half hours I'll go in and check it and make sure that not too much of the liquid has simmered away this is the moment that you always wait for of course because uh you pull it out and you take the top off of it if you've been cooking this in a slow cooker of course it's already filled the house with that delicious Aroma for hours and hours and hours so let's see what we've got here I took a peek earlier just to make sure that it had the right amount of liquid around in it so look at that well it is incredibly aromatic now I am going to take the meat out of here first and remember that it will probably come out in big chunks which we will then break into smaller pieces but we want to work on this braising liquid now so we've got the big pieces of the meat out now I need some fat for this so I'm actually going to pull a uh Ladle up here and tip this up on the side and then collect all the fat off the top so you don't want to be doing this with a really lean cut that's why I'm always choosing to use something like a shoulder roast because there's usually a fair amount of fat and remember I did not encourage you to cut any of the fat off of this but now we're going to degrease this broth because we're going to use the fat both to Brown some of this meat upright before we serve it and also to kind of crisp some tortillas this is a very standard part of making really good birya I need to measure and see how much of this braising liquid we actually have to work with here so I'm going to pour this into a measuring cup because I need about two cups of it let's see what we've got well looks like I hit exactly two cups um if it was more than that I would encourage you to boil it down until you reach that concentration that two top two cup concentration but here I'm going to just simply put it on a very low heat so that it is hot when we want to serve it now our next step here and all of this by the way can be done well in advance of your serving so I always suggest to people that they get their Media made get the meat off of the bones work through like I've got a lot of little bones here that I'm pulling out and then you just look at how incredibly tender that meat is it just folds into large and coarse shreds um there's a little bit more I can get off of that but mostly that is just bone there let's look over here in this piece so you'll see that this is going to come off and let this bone come out in one great big piece um and I think that's going to be kind of what we want to look at there I can use a knife on a lot of these bigger pieces to help me cut them into large shreds but just a couple of these pieces like that so you'll see what I'm going to do here is I'm going to use my knife more as a shredding device like that but everything that's small you'll be able to just tear up with a pair of tongs see oh look at how beautiful that exterior piece of the birya is okay okay that is just very very beautifully shredding on its own there okay now I have a
